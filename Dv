How to recover a file when I have only it's inode and no starting sector I'm using icat

If you only have the inode number of a file and no starting sector, you can use the icat command to recover the file. Here are the steps you can follow:

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file used to exist.

Find the inode number of the file using the ls -i command. The output will show the inode number in the first column and the filename in the second column.

Use the icat command to recover the file. The icat command reads data from a file based on its inode number. The syntax for the icat command is as follows:

icat [options] image-file inode

where image-file is the path to the disk image file and inode is the inode number of the file you want to recover.

For example, if the inode number of the file is 12345 and the disk image file is named diskimage.dd, the command would be:

icat diskimage.dd 12345 > recovered_file

This will recover the file and save it to a new file called recovered_file.

Note that this method may not work if the file has been overwritten or deleted and its blocks have been reused by other files. In that case, the file may be partially or completely corrupted.

Why starting sector is important in this case 

The starting sector is important when trying to recover a file because it is the location on the disk where the file's data is stored. Inodes contain metadata about the file, such as its size, permissions, owner, and modification time, but they do not contain the actual data of the file.

When you run the icat command to recover a file using only the inode number, the command needs to know where the data of the file is located on the disk. If you do not provide the starting sector, the icat command will not know where to start reading the data from, and it will not be able to recover the file.

In general, the starting sector is determined by the file system's allocation algorithm, which determines where on the disk to store the file's data blocks. When a file is created or modified, the file system assigns it a set of contiguous disk blocks to store its data. The starting sector is the sector number of the first disk block in that set.

Therefore, to recover a file, you need both the inode number and the starting sector to locate the data blocks that belong to the file and read the data from them using the icat command.

How to find starting sector 

To find the starting sector of a file on a disk, you can use the debugfs command in Linux. Here are the steps you can follow:

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the disk image file is located.

Use the file command to determine the file system type of the disk image file. For example, if the file system type is ext4, you can use the debugfs command to inspect the file system.

Open the disk image file using the debugfs command. The syntax for the command is as follows:

debugfs -w [disk-image-file]

The -w option opens the disk image file in write mode, which allows you to modify the file system.

Use the stat command to display the metadata of the file whose starting sector you want to find. The syntax for the command is as follows:

stat [path-to-file]

For example, if the file you want to recover is located at /path/to/file, the command would be:

stat /path/to/file

The output will contain the inode number of the file, as well as other metadata such as the size, permissions, and owner.

Use the icheck command to find the block address of the inode. The syntax for the command is as follows:

icheck [inode-number]

For example, if the inode number of the file is 12345, the command would be:

icheck 12345

The output will contain the block address of the inode.

Use the debugfs command to inspect the contents of the block that contains the inode. The syntax for the command is as follows:

debugfs -R "blockdump [block-address]" [disk-image-file]

For example, if the block address of the inode is 54321 and the disk image file is named diskimage.dd, the command would be:

debugfs -R "blockdump 54321" diskimage.dd

The output will contain the contents of the block in hexadecimal format.

Locate the inode entry in the output by searching for the inode number that you found earlier. The inode entry will contain information about the file, including the starting sector of its data blocks.

Note the value of the starting sector, which is located in the inode entry under the i_block field. This is the sector number of the first block that contains the data of the file.

Once you have the starting sector, you can use the icat command to recover the file using the steps I outlined in my previous answer.

Use mmls command 

Another way to find the starting sector of a file on a disk is to use the mmls command, which is part of the sleuthkit suite of forensic tools. Here are the steps you can follow:

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the disk image file is located.

Use the mmls command to display the partition layout of the disk image file. The syntax for the command is as follows:

mmls [disk-image-file]

For example, if the disk image file is named diskimage.dd, the command would be:

mmls diskimage.dd

The output will display the partition layout of the disk, including the start sector and size of each partition.

Identify the partition that contains the file you want to recover. The partition may be a primary partition, extended partition, or logical volume.

Use the fsstat command to display the file system information of the partition. The syntax for the command is as follows:

fsstat [disk-image-file] [partition-start-sector]

For example, if the start sector of the partition is 2048, the command would be:

fsstat diskimage.dd 2048

The output will display the file system information of the partition, including the file system type, block size, and inode information.

Use the fls command to display the directory entries of the file you want to recover. The syntax for the command is as follows:

fls -o [offset] -r [disk-image-file] [partition-start-sector]

Replace [offset] with the offset of the directory that contains the file, and replace [partition-start-sector] with the start sector of the partition.

For example, if the offset of the directory that contains the file is 12345 and the start sector of the partition is 2048, the command would be:

fls -o 12345 -r diskimage.dd 2048

The output will display the directory entries of the directory, including the inode number and filename of the file you want to recover.

Use the istat command to display the metadata of the file, including the starting sector of its data blocks. The syntax for the command is as follows:

istat [disk-image-file] [inode-number]

For example, if the inode number of the file is 12345 and the disk image file is named diskimage.dd, the command would be:

istat diskimage.dd 12345

The output will display the metadata of the file, including the starting sector of its data blocks.

Once you have the starting sector, you can use the icat command to recover the file using the steps I outlined in my previous answer.

Can you make a bash script to automate some of these tasks 

Yes, I can provide you with a bash script that automates some of the tasks involved in recovering a file using its inode number and starting sector. Here's an example script that uses the mmls, fsstat, fls, istat, and icat commands:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# This script recovers a file using its inode number and starting sector.

# Define the disk image file and inode number.
DISK_IMAGE="diskimage.dd"
INODE_NUMBER="12345"

# Find the starting sector of the file.
PARTITION_START=$(mmls "$DISK_IMAGE" | grep "^  [0-9]" | awk '{print $2}')
FSSTAT_OUTPUT=$(fsstat "$DISK_IMAGE" "$PARTITION_START")
INODE_INFO=$(echo "$FSSTAT_OUTPUT" | grep "  $INODE_NUMBER " | awk '{print $2, $3, $4}')
START_SECTOR=$(istat "$DISK_IMAGE" "$INODE_NUMBER" | grep "^Allocated" | awk '{print $3}')

# Recover the file using the starting sector and inode number.
FILE_NAME=$(echo "$FSSTAT_OUTPUT" | grep "$INODE_INFO" | awk '{print $NF}')
FILE_SIZE=$(echo "$FSSTAT_OUTPUT" | grep "File size" | awk '{print $NF}')
OUTPUT_FILE="$FILE_NAME.recovered"
icat -r -f "$DISK_IMAGE" "$PARTITION_START" "$START_SECTOR" "$FILE_SIZE" > "$OUTPUT_FILE"

echo "File $FILE_NAME has been recovered and saved as $OUTPUT_FILE."
Here's how the script works:

Define the DISK_IMAGE and INODE_NUMBER variables with the name of the disk image file and the inode number of the file you want to recover.

Use the mmls command to find the starting sector of the partition that contains the file.

Use the fsstat command to find the file system information of the partition and the metadata of the file.

Use the istat command to find the starting sector of the file.

Use the icat command to recover the file using the starting sector and inode number, and save it to a new file.

Print a message to the console to confirm that the file has been recovered and saved.

You can customize the script by changing the values of the DISK_IMAGE and INODE_NUMBER variables to match your specific use case. Note that this script assumes that the file you want to recover is located on a single partition of the disk image file. If the file is located on multiple partitions, you may need to modify the script to search for the file on each partition.
